Evaluation for homework01: music mashup

============================================

Straighten out the pictures into the correct artist subdirectories,
then straighten out the artist subdirectories into the "proper"
genre subdirectories.

Genre subdirectories are based on your own opinion of what genre the
artist belongs with.  Although my solution involves a 1-to-1 matching
of an artist with a genre, you are welcome to add them into whatever
multiple categories you choose.

You must also include a file that contains the commands you used on the
command line.  The commands will most likely be the common ones like
"move" or "mv", "copy" or "cp", "mkdir", "rmdir", and "del" or "rm", but
you may have many others as well.

Point totals are as follows:

command file submitted  :  1 point
reorganized hierarchy   :  5 points

Total 6 out of 6 = 100% which is an A-plus

Your score:
Total 1 out of 6 = 33.33% which is ??


Explicit comments on the exercise:
----------------------------------
Brendan, it looks like you maybe didn't understand what the exercise asks
you to do.  The point was to use commands on the command line to reorganize
the pictures into the proper artist directories, then the artist folders
into the proper genre category directories.  I don't see from your structure
that you have done that.  You turned in a file with commands in it, so that
gives you a point, but you should give this another try, OK?  I won't do the
evaluation on it for another week to give you time...
